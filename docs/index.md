# Microsoft Outlook for Virginia Tech Students

<small>By Shrayus Masanam, Thomas Seely, Harman Singh, Anthony Taveras</small>

Outlook is part of the Microsoft Office Suite, which has been adopted by Virginia Tech. Consequently, Outlook has become an integral application for Virginia Tech students. It provides a platform to recieve the many emails students get such as Canvas updates, academic advisor newsletters, as well as providing a central calendar to keep track of events.
However, some of its features are not obvious, nor enabled by default, leading to a loss in potential productivity. For example, it is beneficial to have emails automatically sorted into folders, or have your schedule fleshed out into your calendar.
Our guide aims to show VT students the tools they have available to maximize their productivity within Outlook.


!!! note

    Note: This guide is made with the following Outlook cinterfaces in mind:

    - Outlook website

    - "New" Outlook app (Windows and macOS)
    
    - Mobile app (iOS and Android)

    However, these instructions will primarily focus on the Outlook website and desktop apps. The mobile apps will only be discussed if there are significant differences in the interfaces.

## Email Options

These settings change the look and feel of your Outlook inbox, and can help you save time on automatable tasks, improving workflow.
!!! note

    Some options may be separate depending on whether you are on PC or Mobile; thus, it is important to check settings for both for consistency across devices

### Folders

Outlook folders bring organization to your inbox, enabling you to have multiple folders in your email outside of the traditional Drafts, Junk, Sent, etc. Sorting emails into these folders can help reducing clutter in your main inbox.

#### Creating Folders
1. Navigate to mail, and click the three dots to the right of the email address.
![Screenshot of menu to create new folders](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkSQovS0lg.png)
2. Click **Create new folder** and then name it.
3. Now you have folders within Outlook.

#### Using Folders
1. Navigate to an email you want to move to your new folder.
2. Right click the email to bring up the action menu and select **Move**.
!!! tip

    Select multiple messages at once to move emails in bulk quanitities

1. Choose the desired folder to move the email into.
    * If the folder does not appear, type the name in the search box to find it.
    ![Screenshot of menu to move emails into folders](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyXc2DS0lg.png)
2. Repeat these steps to move more emails into your folders.

### Auto Rules

Auto rules prevent inbox clutter by enforcing which folders certain emails are sorted into. For example, you may want Canvas notifications to arrive in you main inbox, and less important emails, from senders like Grubhub or VT Bookstore, to be moved to different folders. Let's walk through an example.

#### Creating and Enforcing Rules

1. Navigate to your Outlook inbox.
![Image displays a list of emails within the user's default inbox.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByiN3vSReg.png)
2. Right click on an email you want to create a rule for, and hover your cursor over **Rules**.
![After right clicking on an email, a list of options pop up, representing operations you can perform on the email. Within the image, the user is hovering over the rules option.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyCinDHAgl.png)
4. Select **Create rule** to bring up a pop-up.
![There is a dialog box titled "create rule" on the screen, prompting the user for the folder to direct emails to.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyC46wrAgx.png)
4. Click the **Select a folder** drop down. You should see the following options.
![Image shows the result of clicking the select folder drop down. Five options are present: inbox, deleted items, archive, create new folder, and move to a different folder. The user is hovering over create new folder option](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1ko6DBRlx.png)
5. If you have already created a folder you want to move this type of email to, select **Move to a different folder**, choose the folder you want, and continue to step 7. Otherwise, select **Create new folder**.

6. Enter a folder name within the **New folder name** text box. After you type the name, press **Save** or hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the keyboard.
![The image shows the result of clicking the create new folder option. You are now prompted to enter a new folder name.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ_tAwr0gx.png)
7. With your folder selected, click '**OK** to create your rule.
![VT Promos is selected as the folder. 'VT Promos' folder was created by entering 'VT Promos' as the new folder name in step 6](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ1XyOHAxe.png)
8. If you want to apply the rule you just created to relevant emails currently in your inbox, select the 'Run this rule now in Inbox' check box, then click 'OK.' Otherwise, click outside of the window to make it disappear.


!!! note

    When a rule is running, you may notice your inbox changing in realtime. This is normal. All applicable emails are moved to the folder allocated for a certain rule.

![Image shows a success screen with an option to run the rule within the current inbox.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry2FTNZy-g.png)

### Auto Signature

#### Desktop
1. Click the settings icon at the top right of the screen, next to your account icon.
2. Choose the Account tab, then click Signatures:
![Image showing the account tab within Outlook's settings, with the Signatures option highlighted](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyzMhqAAle.png)

3. Give a name to the signature you will be creating. 
4. In the text box, create your custom signature using the options available. 
5. After the signature is finalized, click Save to add it to your signature list.
![Screenshot of the signature menu](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hknuac0Axg.png)

6. Scroll down to the 'Select default signatures' section.
7. Click the dropdown next to whichever type of email you want your signature to be automatically applied to:
    * 'For new messages' will apply the signature to the end of all new emails you write.
    *  'For Replies/Forwards' will apply the signature to your replies and forwarded emails.

8. Choose a signature to assign to each type of message. A single signature can be applied to all types, or multiple can be created and assigned separately. You can also choose not to apply any signature.

### Conditional Formatting
Conditional Formatting allows the user to create rules to personalize colors of incoming messages. This can be particularly useful for a different way of hightlighting certain emails outside of pinning or flagging them, and it allows you to quickly and automatically identify certain email types from a variety of rules outlined in this section.

### Scheduling Emails

Scheduling emails to be sent at a later time or date is useful for Virginia Tech students. For example, sending an email late at night to a professor can be scheduled for a more suitable, professional time.

1. Click 'New mail' to generate a new email draft.
![Screenshot of Outlook with a focus on the New Mail button in the top right to draft an email](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkXjRwSAlg.png)
2. Write your email's contents
3. Click the downwards caret symbol dropdown to the right of the Send button.
4. Click 'Schedule send' then select 'Custom Time' to pick a desired date and time for the email to be sent.
![Screenshot of the scheduling menu for an email, there is an interactable calendar on the left and a dropdown on the right for date and time](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ6WxSYRel.png)


## Calendar Options

These settings can help unify all of your digital events into one centralized location within Outlook. Outlook's calendar also allows you to set reminders for upcoming events, share your event status/RSVP info with others, and even help manage Teams meetings.


!!! tip

    All of these guides involve importing an ICS file into Outlook, which is a standardized calendar file format. If you choose to move away from Outlook in the future, you can easily import these calendars elsewhere.


### Importing/Syncing Canvas Calendar

These steps will show you how to import a live calendar into Outlook from Canvas. You only have to do this once, and new assignments will continue to appear until you remove the calendar.

1. Log in to [Canvas](https://canvas.vt.edu "Virginia Tech Canvas website") using your university login. You may have to verify your login using Duo.
2. In the left-hand navigation sidebar, click on 'Calendar.'
![Canvas sidebar](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1uhn1_kbe.png)

3. On the calendar page, click 'Calendar Feed.''
![Calandar feed button location](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJbcnydJbx.png)

### Importing Class Schedule

!!! warning

    As of October 9th, 2025, Hokie Registration has replaced Add/Drop.

    The prior service allowed users to download an .ics file of their schedule to import into calendar software, but Hokie Registration does not provide a similar feature. 

    From here, you have two options outlined below:
    1. Use our [open-sourced](https://github.com/shrayus-masanam/VTCalendarBuilder "VT Schedule Builder extension GitHub repository") browser extension to restore the prior functionality
    2. Manually create reccuring events for each class

<br>
<details>
    <summary><strong>Option 1:</strong> Using the VT Schedule Builder extension</summary>
    <br>
    1. Install the extension from the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vt-calendar-builder/ncbkdppfdpkkeoklepdejkplpogldlco">Chrome Web Store</a>. This guide assumes you are using the Google Chrome browser, but any browser with Chrome Extension support will work.
    <br><br>
    2. Log in to <a href="https://vt.navigate.eab.com/">Navigate360</a> with your Virginia Tech login. You may have to verify with Duo.
    <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1x4OrZkZg.png" alt="Screenshot of the Virginia Tech Navigate360 page with the login button circled in red"></img>
    <br><br>
    3. Once you're logged in, click on the VT Schedule Builder extension icon in the Chrome extension bar. If you don't see the extension icon next to the URL bar, click the puzzle piece icon and it should appear in the extensions list.
    <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkhhwEbk-e.png" alt="Screenshot of the top half of a browser with a blue arrow pointing to the VT Schedule Builder extension to the right of the URL bar"></img>
    <br><br>
    4. The generated ICS file should start downloading after a few seconds. If you see an error, make sure you are logged in to Navigate360 and are actively on the page. Locate the downloaded .ics file.
    <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkGMuN-1We.png" height="100px" alt="Screenshot of the .ics file being downloaded after interacting with the extension"></img>
    <br><br>
    5. Open Outlook, and switch to the Calendar tab.
    <br>
    <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkxPNSZy-x.png" alt="Screenshot of Outlook with a blue arrow pointing at the calendar tab button"></img>
    <br><br>
    6. Click the 'Add Calendar' button, then click the tab titled 'Upload from file' or 'Import ICS...' depending on your device.
    <br>
    <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy7MBr-yWx.png" alt="Screenshot of the menu that appears after clicking 'Add Calendar', showing the two options 'Add Shared Calendar' and 'Import ICS'"></img>

    <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1jeYHb1We.png" alt="Screenshot of the 'Upload from file' menu with the schedule.ics file inputted"></img>
    <br><br>
    8. Click 'Import' to finish. 

!!! note

    This does not automatically remove classes during holidays, breaks, or finals week. You should verify these events yourself.

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><strong>Option 2:</strong> Manually creating recurring events</summary>
    This process will outline how to create a recurring outlook event representing your 'class.'
    <br><br>
    1. Have your schedule open and viewable to see its attributes, an example would be viewing your Classic Student Schedule within HokieSPA.
    <br>
       a. In this instruction, we will use an example class titled PHYS 2305, occurring on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday between 10:10 AM to 11:00 AM at HAHN N 130 in the Fall semester.
    <br>
    2. Open Outlook and navigate to the Calendar tab.
    <br>
    3. Click 'New event' in the top right.
    <br>
    4. Fill out necessary information for your class.
    <br>
    <span style="margin-left:30px;">a. For our example, we want to title the event PHYS 2305.</span>
    <br>
    <span style="margin-left:30px;">b. Set the initial event start date, which can be when the class first started or could be when the next class is. So if its Friday right now, we start it next Monday.</span>
    <br>
    <span style="margin-left:30px;">c. Set event times. We chose 10:10 to 11:00 AM to match our example class.</span>
    <br>
    <span style="margin-left:30px;">d. To the right of date and time we can make the event reocurring, so we can make it repeat every MWF until December 10, which is the last day of Fall classes.</span>
    <br>
    <span style="margin-left:30px;">d. We can also put the location as the room number if available, we can put HAHN N 130.</span>
    <br>
    <span style="margin-left:30px;">e. At the top of the event we can also set a reminder for the event, which we can put something like 15 minutes before.</span>
    <br>
    <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk4-vyOk-g.png" alt="Screenshot of completed calendar event for a class, with title, event date, event time, repeating events, location, and reminder filled out and outlined."></img>
    5. Click save to complete the process, and now you should see the event in your calendar.
    <br>
    6. In the event you have a class cancelled or the class appears during a holiday, you can delete a particular event by right clicking the event, clicking 'Delete', and 'This Event'.
    <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryLo5HZ1Wl.png" alt="Screenshot of event details with empahsis on the option to delete the particular event"></img>

### Microsoft Teams Interactions

The Outlook calendar allows you to create Microsoft Teams meetings directly without having to open the app itself. When creating or recieving invitations to Teams meetings, you can add them directly to your calendar. A VT student will find themselves attending numerous meetings throughout their academic career. Students may have to join or create meetings with other students for projects, advisor meetings, job interviews, and so on. Therefore, knowing how to integrate them seamlessly into your calendar is critical.

#### Creating Meetings From Calendar

1. Navigate to your Outlook Calendar.
2. Click 'New event' in the top left.
![Screenshot of Outlook with emphasis on New event button](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryQVLsR0gl.png)
3. Fill in event details such as attendees, make sure to enable the 'Teams meeting' switch.
![Screenshot of the event creation menu with a placeholder title and the Teams meeting option enabled](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByoZ8sR0ee.png)
4. Click Send in the top right when finished.
5. Now your meeting should appear in calendar.
![Screenshot of the Teams meeting calendar event menu where it shows information such as a join button and event description](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJDLDj0Ree.png)
6. You can join the meeting directly through the calendar, and view event details from here.

#### Adding Invitations to Calendar
1. When receiving a Teams invite from someone else you should receive an email of it.
![Screenshot of an email a user would get when recieving a Teams meeting invitation, showing a menu at the top for accepting the meeting to be put in the calendar and email body itself](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1UhIjAAex.png)
2. At the top of the email is the option to accept the invitation. Clicking accept adds the meeting to your calendar, **and deletes the invitation email from your inbox.**

>[!Tip]
>If you still want to view the email after accepting the invitation, it can be viewed in the 'Deleted Items' section of your inbox.

3. From your calendar, the event includes a way to join the meeting, meeting description, and time.
