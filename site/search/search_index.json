Consequently, Outlook has become an integral application for Virginia Tech students. It provides a platform to recieve the many emails students get such as Canvas updates, academic advisor newsletters, as well as providing a central calendar to keep track of events.</p> <p>However, some of Outlook's features are not obvious, nor enabled by default, leading to a loss in potential productivity. For example, many users don't know that you can set up the software to automatically sort your emails into folders, or have your schedule automatically imported into your calendar. Our guide aims to show VT students the tools they have available to maximize their productivity within Outlook.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This guide is made with the following Outlook interfaces in mind:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Outlook website</p> </li> <li> <p>\"New\" Outlook app (Windows and macOS)</p> </li> <li> <p>Mobile app (iOS and Android)</p> </li> </ul> <p>However, these instructions will primarily focus on the Outlook website and desktop apps.

Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store. This guide assumes you are using the Google Chrome browser, but any browser with Chrome Extension support will work.          2. Log in to Navigate360 with your Virginia Tech login. You may have to verify with Duo.           3. Once you're logged in, click on the VT Schedule Builder extension icon in the Chrome extension bar. If you don't see the extension icon next to the URL bar, click the puzzle piece icon and it should appear in the extensions list.           4. The generated ICS file should start downloading after a few seconds. If you see an error, make sure you are logged in to Navigate360 and are actively on the page.

Click Import to finish.    <p></p> Option 2: Manually creating recurring events     This process will outline how to create a recurring outlook event representing one of your classes.          1. Have your schedule open and viewable to see its attributes, an example would be viewing your Classic Student Schedule within HokieSPA.             a. In this instruction, we will use an example class titled PHYS 2305, occurring on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday between 10:10 AM to 11:00 AM at HAHN N 130 in the Fall semester.          2. Open Outlook and navigate to the Calendar tab.          3. Click New event in the top right.          4. Fill out necessary information for your class.      a. For our example, we want to title the event PHYS 2305. b. Set the initial event start date, which can be when the class first started or could be when the next class is. So if its Friday right now, we start it next Monday. c. Set event times. We chose 10:10 to 11:00 AM to match our example class. d. To the right of date and time we can make the event reocurring, so we can make it repeat every MWF until December 10, which is the last day of Fall classes. d. We can also put the location as the room number if available, we can put HAHN N 130. e. At the top of the event we can also set a reminder for the event, which we can put something like 15 minutes before.      5. Click save to complete the process, and now you should see the event in your calendar.          6. In the event you have a class cancelled or the class appears during a holiday, you can delete a particular event by right clicking the event, clicking Delete, and This Event.      <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>These methods do not automatically remove classes during holidays, breaks, or finals week. You should verify these events yourself.</p>"},{"location":"#importing-gobblerconnect-events","title":"Importing GobblerConnect Events","text":"<p>GobblerConnect is the student hub for a variety of organizations and events happening on campus.
